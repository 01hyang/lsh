LSH
===

LSH is my little attempt at a *real* shell in C.  It's called LSH because it's
supposed to be the Libstephen SHell.  That's because I hope that if this shell
becomes anything, it could become a part of Libstephen as a shell library.  It
would have a simple shell syntax, maybe optional globbing, and it would be
simple to plug any set of commands into it.  That way, it could be used for
quick interfaces by defining simple commands.

But right now, it's just a simple shell to demonstrate that I know how a shell
works.  That is, read, parse, fork, exec, and wait.  So I think it's pretty
cool.
